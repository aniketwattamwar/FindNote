Crowdstrike SWE:
I enjoy solving problems using technology and the job description aligns with my skills and interests. My core skills are in Python and full-stack development with AWS as cloud technology. As a CS graduate student, I have also taken courses like Software Design and architecture, web-backend, and software standards and requirements allowing me to expand my knowledge in software development like distributed systems, cross-platform development using REST API, and software processes like Agile and more.
I believe this opportunity would be a great learning experience and I am confident I would be able to perform above and beyond.

python, java, mysql, aws, nosql, java, c++, jenkins, appdynamics, splunk, linux, html/css, react, django, flask, aws RDS, aws lambda, aws elastic beanstalk, aws ec2


Crowdstrike ML:

I enjoy solving problems using technology and the job description aligns with my skills and interest. My core skills are in python and Machine learning development along with AWS as cloud technology. As a CS graduate student I have also taken courses like Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, web-backend allowing me to expand my knowledge in the Machine learning domain.
I can work in Python tensorflow/keras and learning PyTorch for deep learning. My industry experience has been in MLOps too where our team used to deploy XGBoost models on more than 100 servers.
I believe this opportunity would be a great learning experience and I am confident I would be able to perform above and beyond.

It's not only software but a combination of software, hardware, and mechanical fields as well. So, I own a 3d printer(Ender 3). I am just amazed at its possibilities. With unlimited resources, the first thing I would do is fasten the printing process and fix all the issues that it currently has.
The thing that I would personally keep on doing would be 3d printed prosthetics for disabled people. I see a lot of potential in that area. Another would be 3D-printed car parts/accessories(Japan already started this in E-Vehicles). There are many many use cases for this. 3D printed houses/homes as well(started in Kerala, India).

Why would I do this? Well, it drastically reduces a lot of effort(making plastic/metal molds) and significantly increases the customization power of making anything personalized or generic as well. 

Since I already have one I never thought of making this for business/commercial use. I just enjoy that part of technology and I print things for my house. I got to learn mechanical 3d modeling and design, some hardware stuff on the printer and then coding some stuff(gcode files). Automated software can be made that generate .stl file directly to print.

#Hackathon2 #LAHacks2023
I am excited to share that I got the chance to attend the UCLA's LAHacks Hackathon. It was a 36-hour hackathon with lots of learning, developing, fun and networking. 

I decided to participate individually for this Hackathon and developed a webapp called Connect - Bridging the Gap in solving the food wastage problem. The webapp connects Restaurants, Hotels to nearby NGOs to distrbute the food to the needy people/ food banks and avoid wastage. Check out the working of the app here: Connect - Bridging the gap

I met some amazing developers during the hackathon and it was inspiring to see the projects they developed.

HPC Performance Engineer Graduate (1163457)

MLH!
Why do you want to become an MLH fellow?

I have always been fond of technology and programming since my undergrad years. My interest in programming grew because our university made us do practical projects and publish the results in research publications. So every semester we had to make different projects and when I look back now it seem to be the reason for my current passion for technology.
Fast forward to my final year I got hired by HSBC and worked as a software engineer there in Machine Learning, MLOps and then in Full stack development for more than 2 years crafting solutions to real-life problems. After that I decided to come to the US for my masters(Fall22) in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton.

In the last 1.5 years of my stay here in the US, I have attended 3 hackathons Treehacks Stanford, LAHacks UCLA and CalHacks UCB. I just enjoy the energy and making connections and completing a project at a Hackathon. I grabbed an internship offer during summer at Lumen Technologies and worked in Full stack ML development. 
This really gave me the push and made me realize that I want to continue working in software technology. I gained tremendous advanced knowledge while studying Masters in all aspects of software development. I continue to work on personal projects as I learn new concepts. I work as an Research Assistant in Computational Epidemiology with a Professor at the University. I am also a junior admin at the Mathematics department handling 2 High Performance Super Computers at my University. I also got a chance to present my research work at the STARS Computing conference in Dallas, Texas.
I am so grateful for these opportunities and consider these my achievements and that hard work pays off sooner or later.
 
For me one should keep on adapting to the world of technology and the best example is how LLMs captured the market and now as technology enthusiasts we need to learn it and apply in real life.

In my last semester of Masters, I think this fellowship would be great opportunity to learn something new and contribute to open-source. My experience and learnings will definitely help me contribute effectively.



The MLH Fellowship is a diverse community that welcomes Fellows from a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. What perspective or experience will you bring to the fellowship to strengthen our community?

I have learned a lot through the software community. During the covid pandemic, I decided that it's time to give back to the community in whatever way possible. That’s when, I decided to start a YouTube channel - HackerShrine and make videos for experienced software developers. 
If you check my content I try to make videos on full stack development covering a range of technology in one use case, eg FastAPI with React and AWS DynamoDB. This covers three technologies and the tutorial is on a real life use case. I always keep all of my code open source so anyone can read, learn and further contribute to it. My YouTube channel helped me learn video editing, designing, SEO and Optimization too. 
I answer few questions on stack overflow or discussions page too(of Streamlit). I have a blogging website hackershrine.com where I post articles on Interview Experiences to help anyone trying to get a software engineer job.
I am also a writer on Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya on Medium. Since I have made considerable amount of YouTube content on AWS, Python I was selected for the AWS Community Builder Program for 2 years now.  I am also a teaching associate for frontend technologies course in my University teaching undergraduate students.

 These are some of the things that I have experience with which would add value to MLH community. I will share my experience in YouTube, Marketing, Software Development, Writing blogs and more to everyone and to the MLH community.

After looking at the job description, I can confidently say that it matches my profile, skills and previous experience. Interestingly, I also worked for a bank for 2 years in ML and MLOps domain developing and deploying ML models with Python, something that CVS is looking for.
 
I am attaching my resume for your consideration, it highlights my skills, experiences and ML projects along with my contribution to developer community on StackOverflow and YouTube.
 
I would love to talk more about the role if we can connect on call anytime as per your convenience.
 
Thank you.

I am applying for the Purpura Internship Scholarship as I interned during the summer for 10 weeks at Lumen Technologies as a software developer. I worked on 3 different projects enhancing my skills in full stack development and machine learning. I had courses like web backend and artificial neural networks during my Masters which really helped in the internship. I worked on multiple technologies some of which were very new and some familiar. 

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science here at CSU Fullerton. I am a Research Assistant at the CEDDI Lab under Professor Sampson Akwafuo developing real time dashboard and monitoring tool for Lassa Fever. The research was accepted in the STARS Computing Poster conference held at Dallas, Texas in 2023 where I got to present the findings and work done. I was a contributor to another research paper named -  Real-time Hybrid Dashboard and App for Mpox Outbreak Surveillance(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10355026) which is available on the IEEE Xplore. For the Spring 2024 semester, I am working as a Teaching Assistant for the course CPSC 349-02 Frontend Engineering. Apart from this I also work at the Center of Computational and Applied Mathematics Department of CSUF on Supercomputers as a High Performance Computing (HPC) Student Assistant in the domain of linux, servers, python and more. I also participated in the Social Justice Competition held at CSU Fullerton working on an idea to reduce food wastage problem. In 2023, I attended 3 hackathons - Treehacks at Stanford, LAHacks at UCLA and CalHacks at UCB working on ideas and completing them during the duration of the hackathon.

I am an international student and my parents are retired now. My father worked as a Manager in a private company and my mother is a homemaker.

I have 2+ years of experience in software development and recently interned at Lumen Technologies as software developer. I wish to work as a software developer for the next couple of years and slowly transition towards an software architect role in the longer run as a career path.

This scholarship will help me a lot since as an international student I have taken an education loan. The Purpura internship scholarship will help me pay some part of my fees and reduce the loan amount to some extent. I am glad and proud to say that since I worked as an RA and now TA I am able to manage some of my living expenses with its salary.

Leetcode Algo - Feymann Technique Section

Sunday, February 26, 2023
7:04 PM


289. Game of life	Use bit encoding type of solution to save state, like 0->1 then 2, 1->1 will be 3.
48. Rotate Image	Do swapping and reverse the matrix
54. Spiral Matrix	Take 4 variables and individual create the spiral matrix
56. Merge Intervals	Interval problm so make a timeline for better chances of solving problem.
	Sort and iterate while checking prev end and curr start, if true then change interval else not
57. Insert Interval	Take min of starts and max of ends to insert
150. Eval RPN	Take stack and pop elements when expression is found and calculate to push stack val back to stack
224. Basic Calculator	Take sign, stack, res. Keep track of sign and res in a list. Pop them and multiple sign and add the other value
2. Add Two Numbers	Take carry, l1val l2val and know how to use total%10 and total//10
92. Reversed Linked List	Hard to code, but came up with logic.
	Take a dummy node at start to handle edge cases also. Go till left then reverse till Right and adjust the pointers 
	after the right to get the final result.
61. Rotate List	Break the link at the desired node and just attach the remaining to the start of the list
86. Partition list	Take two list left and right. Smaller than x goes to left and bigger goes to right. Once done just connect left and right to get the final list of the solution
226. Invert BT	Just swap two elements and then call recursively left and right nodes
105. Construct BT from preorder and inorder	Preorder tells you root and inorder tell you till which node you have to put the values in left tree. 
106. Construct BT from inorder and postorder	Similar logic as 105 above. Get the root and pop the elements from the postorder list. But recursively call root.right first since postorder is rRL
138. Copy LL with random pointer	Do two passes. One pass to make just the nodes with deep copy. Second pass to do the linking wrt to the original LL. Use dict to store old to new
129. Sum root leaf numbers	Recursively get the number and store as left and right and just return left+right from the inner dfs funciton. The number created as num*10 + root.val
114. Flatten binary tree	A bit tricky to code the solution. Inner function to reroute pointer and call recursively.
117. Populating next right pointers II	Do BFS and just connect to next node
236. Least Common ancestor for two nodes	Do recursive call and just check if l and r are present if yes then return root
199. Binary right side view	Just do BFS and add the last element to queue
173. Binary Search Tree iterator	Use stack and perform in order. Pop elements and traverse towards the left nodes for inorder.
98. Validate BST	Perform inorder and check if the sorted set list is equal to the non sorted list  if yes its BST else not
207. Course Schedule	Do DFS. This is graph problem where check for a cycle in the graph if found then return False.
108. Array to BST	Take midpoint and do recursion by making nodes. Since the array is sorted then the BST would be constructed directly
127. Word Ladder	Difficult to problem. Graph with BFS. Make graph using defaultdict(list). Trick to create the correct graph. Eg. H*t = [hot, hit, …] words are stored like this.
Saw neetcode solution
79. Word Search	Do 4 calls with OR and take a visited set array to store i,j and remove it after recursive calls.
23. Merge K Sorted Lists	Put all LL values in an array, sort it and then create nodes in another loop
53. Maximum Subarray	Kadane algorithm. Keep adding numbers if negative then reset to 0. take max of currMax with globalMax and that is the answer
918. Max Sum Circular Subarray	
373. K smallest pairs	Use heap and store the next 2 pairs. Once you pop from the heap it will be minimum sum indexes and append it to ans.
502. IPO	Make capital profit vector and use max heap to store max profit. So every time u pop u get max proft and add to w to get final ans
198. House Robber 	Create a 1d DP array. Choose the current and two places behind money or just the prev one whichever is greater and return the last dp value
120. Triangle	Using DP. Start from bottom and just add minimum of upper value and upper right value. Ans will be at 0,0
64. Minimum Path Sum	Use 2d DP and add previous minimum value with current grid value
63. Unique Paths II	Use 2d DP with obstacle changing to 0 when see it and others changing/adding to the current value
97. Interleaving String	Use 2d dp. Rows cols is s1 and s2 and compare each position with s3 value. Tricky question to visulize
188. Buy and Sell Stock IV	2d dp with transactions as rows and prices as columns and you calculate the max profit for all previous days till ystrday for 1 transaction and the second transction will be ystrday buy and today sell, whichever is maximum. Algorihtms made easy solution was easy to understand
399. Evaluate Division	Use dfs or bfs createa defauldict(dict) to store the nodes. Basically you need to make a graph which goes a-> b -> and has value and then the inverse value of the reverse path. Hard to code.
4. Median of two sorted arrays	Use Two pointers or binary search to solve.
805. Split array with same avg	Calculate total sum and avg, then look for a  subset of numbers whose avg is close to half of the total avg. If found return True since the second subset avg will be equal. Uses a possible sets dict/set to find all sets and then look for avg half to the total.
1895. Largest Magic Square	
287. Find duplicate number	To adhere to the conditions and solving the problem --> Use Floyds cycle detection algorithm i.e slow-fast pointer approach
547. Number of Provinces	Do dfs. You just have to check if from any city i  how many j are connected with i,j as 1. Doable problem in interview if you understand the question.
205. Isomorphic Strings	Create two dict and match the values. If same then true else false.
179. Largest Number	Basically a sorting problem, but need to write your own sorting logic. Convert to strings and join current number with next and check which is larger. If larger then swap else pass. Do this for all numbers. TC is O(n^2)
135. Candy	
221. Maximal Square	Using DP. Check each cell as the end of a square and take the minimum in up, left, and backward diagonal.



























Sliding Window

def sliding_window(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Initialize two pointers for the start and end of the window
    left, right = 0, 0
    # Initialize variables for the current window and the maximum value found so far
    curr_window, max_window = 0, 0

    # Loop through the string using the right pointer as the loop variable
    while right < n:
        # Expand the window to the right by moving the right pointer
        curr_window += s[right]

        # Check if the current window is valid, if so, update the maximum value found so far
        while # condition for an invalid window:
            # Shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer
            curr_window -= s[left]
            left += 1

        # Update the maximum value found so far
        max_window = max(max_window, curr_window)

        # Move the right pointer to expand the window further
        right += 1

    return max_window

Breadth First Search

from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    # Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
 
    while queue:
        # Get the next node from the queue
        node = queue.popleft()

        # Process the current node
        # ...

        # Add the unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                visited.add(neighbor)


In place problems:

take another pointer like i
2 pointer

Depth First Search

def dfs(graph, start, visited=set()):
    # Process the current node
    # ...

    # Mark the current node as visited
    visited.add(start)

    # Recursively visit the unvisited neighbors of the current node
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

te-packages/deepmd/train/trainer.py:1189: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is de
precated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.

Fetch.ai

Hi Ed,

It was really nice meeting you at the LAHacks and fun debugging the dependency issues of reflex and fetch.ai.
Just FYI, the workaround was don’t write any fetch.ai code in reflex code when performing 'reflex run' then the dependency error won’t occur ;)

I am reaching out to continue our discussion on making videos on my YouTube channel - Aniket Wattamwar. I have over 1.1k subscribers with overall 200k+ views and growing. My content is on full stack, react, fastAPI, ML, Python, AWS, Data Science and more.

It would be really interesting to make real life use cases videos using fetch.ai. If fetch.ai is open to sponsor a video or a series of videos, I believe it would be helpful for everyone.

I would like to discuss more on a call if that's possible. I am in Pacific(PDT) Time. Do let me know your available time this week or next week as per your convenience.

Regards,
Aniket




Streamlit

Hi Team,

Hope you are doing well. I am a senior software developer here in California. 

I absolutely love your product. Congratulations on joining Snowflake. I have been following you guys for a long time(3 years) and have seen Streamlit add features and grow exponentially.

I am reaching out to you again for a sponsorship proposal. I have made videos on my YouTube channel - Aniket Wattamwar and was planning to make more. If you guys are interested in sponsoring a video or a series of videos, I believe it would very beneficial for everyone.

I would like to discuss more on a call if that's possible. It would really help if you direct me to the right person as well.


Aniket

Hi Elliot,
I am a software developer and a YouTuber. Reaching out to you if HyperScience would like to be a sponsor of my videos. I would be happy to brief my audience about HyperScience in my videos.

Reflex


Hey Nikhil,

It was great talking to you at LAHacks and absolutely love your product.  Reaching out to initiate our discussion to create content on reflex. 
This is my YouTube channel -  Aniket Wattamwar and my videos are on programming with python, aws, fullstack, fastAPI, react, Django and more.

It would be really great if Reflex can sponsor a video or a series of videos, I believe it would be beneficial for everyone.

I would like to discuss more on a call if that’s possible. I am in the Pacific(PDT) time. Do let me know your availability and we can discuss further.
