I am looking for a summer’23 internship in software engineering.\\n\\nMy skills are in Data Structures and algorithms, System Design along with Python and Full stack Development. I have completed projects in AWS, flask, and Django with MySQL Database. I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving problems.\\n\\nI wish to apply for the software engineering intern position at AWS.\\n\\nAttaching my resume for your reference.\\nYou can have a look at my portfolio as well:\\nhttps://aniketwattamwar.netlify.app/\\n\\nThanks,\\nAniket\\n\\n——-\\n\\nCrowdstrike SWE:\\nI enjoy solving problems using technology and the job description aligns with my skills and interests. My core skills are in Python and full-stack development with AWS as cloud technology. As a CS graduate student, I have also taken courses like Software Design and architecture, web-backend, and software standards and requirements allowing me to expand my knowledge in software development like distributed systems, cross-platform development using REST API, and software processes like Agile and more.\\nI believe this opportunity would be a great learning experience and I am confident I would be able to perform above and beyond.\\n\\npython, java, mysql, aws, nosql, java, c++, jenkins, appdynamics, splunk, linux, html/css, react, django, flask, aws RDS, aws lambda, aws elastic beanstalk, aws ec2\\n\\n\\nCrowdstrike ML:\\n\\nI enjoy solving problems using technology and the job description aligns with my skills and interest. My core skills are in python and Machine learning development along with AWS as cloud technology. As a CS graduate student I have also taken courses like Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, web-backend allowing me to expand my knowledge in the Machine learning domain.\\nI can work in Python tensorflow/keras and learning PyTorch for deep learning. My industry experience has been in MLOps too where our team used to deploy XGBoost models on more than 100 servers.\\nI believe this opportunity would be a great learning experience and I am confident I would be able to perform above and beyond.\\n\\nIt\\'s not only software but a combination of software, hardware, and mechanical fields as well. So, I own a 3d printer(Ender 3). I am just amazed at its possibilities. With unlimited resources, the first thing I would do is fasten the printing process and fix all the issues that it currently has.\\nThe thing that I would personally keep on doing would be 3d printed prosthetics for disabled people. I see a lot of potential in that area. Another would be 3D-printed car parts/accessories(Japan already started this in E-Vehicles). There are many many use cases for this. 3D printed houses/homes as well(started in Kerala, India).\\n\\nWhy would I do this? Well, it drastically reduces a lot of effort(making plastic/metal molds) and significantly increases the customization power of making anything personalized or generic as well. \\n\\nSince I already have one I never thought of making this for business/commercial use. I just enjoy that part of technology and I print things for my house. I got to learn mechanical 3d modeling and design, some hardware stuff on the printer and then coding some stuff(gcode files). Automated software can be made that generate .stl file directly to print.\\n\\nfrom:\\tEzell, Nikolaus <nikolaus.ezell@citi.com>\\nto:\\tShreyas Prashant Kulkarni <sk385@buffalo.edu>\\ncc:\\t\"Muniz, Yarali\" <yarali.muniz@citi.com>\\n\\nCITI bank\\n\\n\\nto:\\tAlysha-Beth Rodriguez <AlyshaBeth.Rodriguez1@aexp.com>\\ncc:\\tShelby Tucker <Shelby.Tucker@aexp.com>\\n\\nAmex\\n\\n\"Smith, Deb\" <Deb.Smith@bestbuy.com>,\\nTisha.Schmidt@bestbuy.com\\n\\n<Lindsey.Henderson@cvshealth.com>\\n\\n\\nfrom:\\tNicole Palisoc <nbaarde@yelp.com>\\nto:\\tsk385@buffalo.edu\\ncc:\\tcoles@yelp.com\\n\\n\"Wood, Daniel [C]\" <wodadan@amazon.com>\\n\\nGabrielle Tocchini <gtocchini@adobe.com>\\nto:\\tShreyas Prashant Kulkarni <sk385@buffalo.edu>\\ncc:\\tMeghan Milani <milani@adobe.com>\\n\\nMarrero, Elizabeth <elizabeth.marrero@delta.com>\\n\\nShow, Sara <Sara.Show@dell.com>\\nto:\\t\"sk385@buffalo.edu\" <sk385@buffalo.edu>\\ncc:\\t\"Torres, Iliana - Dell Team\" <Iliana.Torres@dellteam.com>\\n\\nBriana.Zerfass@cvshealth.com\\n\\nJoon Seung Han <joonseunghan@microsoft.com>\\n\\n\"Pichardo, Katrina (ETW - FLEX)\" <Katrina.Pichardo@nike.com>\\n\\nFelecia Ellis (CW) <fellis@paypal.com>\\n\\nAdams, Garrett <Garrett.Adams@nike.com>\\n\\nSteven Fritz <steven.fritz@nielsen.com>\\n\\nSpencer Gamble <sgamble@adobe.com>\\n\\nmohammed.ahmed3@synechron.com\\n\\nLinkedin Post LAHacks:\\n\\n#Hackathon2 #LAHacks2023\\nI am excited to share that I got the chance to attend the UCLA\\'s LAHacks Hackathon.

My interest in programming grew because our university made us do practical projects and publish the results in research publications. So every semester we had to make different projects and when I look back now it seem to be the reason for my current passion for technology.\\nFast forward to my final year I got hired by HSBC and worked as a software engineer there in Machine Learning, MLOps and then in Full stack development for more than 2 years crafting solutions to real-life problems. After that I decided to come to the US for my masters(Fall22) in Computer Science from California State University, Fullerton.\\n\\nIn the last 1.5 years of my stay here in the US, I have attended 3 hackathons Treehacks Stanford, LAHacks UCLA and CalHacks UCB. I just enjoy the energy and making connections and completing a project at a Hackathon. I grabbed an internship offer during summer at Lumen Technologies and worked in Full stack ML development. \\nThis really gave me the push and made me realize that I want to continue working in software technology. I gained tremendous advanced knowledge while studying Masters in all aspects of software development. I continue to work on personal projects as I learn new concepts. I work as an Research Assistant in Computational Epidemiology with a Professor at the University. I am also a junior admin at the Mathematics department handling 2 High Performance Super Computers at my University. I also got a chance to present my research work at the STARS Computing conference in Dallas, Texas.\\nI am so grateful for these opportunities and consider these my achievements and that hard work pays off sooner or later.\\n \\nFor me one should keep on adapting to the world of technology and the best example is how LLMs captured the market and now as technology enthusiasts we need to learn it and apply in real life.\\n\\nIn my last semester of Masters, I think this fellowship would be great opportunity to learn something new and contribute to open-source. My experience and learnings will definitely help me contribute effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe MLH Fellowship is a diverse community that welcomes Fellows from a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. What perspective or experience will you bring to the fellowship to strengthen our community?\\n\\nI have learned a lot through the software community. During the covid pandemic, I decided that it\\'s time to give back to the community in whatever way possible. That’s when, I decided to start a YouTube channel - HackerShrine and make videos for experienced software developers. \\nIf you check my content I try to make videos on full stack development covering a range of technology in one use case, eg FastAPI with React and AWS DynamoDB. This covers three technologies and the tutorial is on a real life use case. I always keep all of my code open source so anyone can read, learn and further contribute to it. My YouTube channel helped me learn video editing, designing, SEO and Optimization too. \\nI answer few questions on stack overflow or discussions page too(of Streamlit). I have a blogging website hackershrine.com where I post articles on Interview Experiences to help anyone trying to get a software engineer job.\\nI am also a writer on Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya on Medium. Since I have made considerable amount of YouTube content on AWS, Python I was selected for the AWS Community Builder Program for 2 years now.  I am also a teaching associate for frontend technologies course in my University teaching undergraduate students.\\n\\n These are some of the things that I have experience with which would add value to MLH community. I will share my experience in YouTube, Marketing, Software Development, Writing blogs and more to everyone and to the MLH community.\\n\\nCVS Health Email:\\n\\nDear Lindsey,\\n \\nI hope this email finds you well. My name is Aniket Wattamwar, a Computer Science graduate at California State University, Fullerton.\\n \\nYesterday, a job was posted on the CVS Health career page which caught my attention. These are the details of the job role:\\nJob ID: R0046971\\nCategory: Data and Analytics\\nLocation: Chicago, IL\\nJob Link: Data Scientist - Finance Analytics\\n \\nAfter looking at the job description, I can confidently say that it matches my profile, skills and previous experience. Interestingly, I also worked for a bank for 2 years in ML and MLOps domain developing and deploying ML models with Python, something that CVS is looking for.\\n \\nI am attaching my resume for your consideration, it highlights my skills, experiences and ML projects along with my contribution to developer community on StackOverflow and YouTube.\\n \\nI would love to talk more about the role if we can connect on call anytime as per your convenience.\\n \\nThank you.\\n\\nI am applying for the Purpura Internship Scholarship as I interned during the summer for 10 weeks at Lumen Technologies as a software developer. I worked on 3 different projects enhancing my skills in full stack development and machine learning. I had courses like web backend and artificial neural networks during my Masters which really helped in the internship. I worked on multiple technologies some of which were very new and some familiar. \\n\\nI am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science here at CSU Fullerton. I am a Research Assistant at the CEDDI Lab under Professor Sampson Akwafuo developing real time dashboard and monitoring tool for Lassa Fever. The research was accepted in the STARS Computing Poster conference held at Dallas, Texas in 2023 where I got to present the findings and work done. I was a contributor to another research paper named -  Real-time Hybrid Dashboard and App for Mpox Outbreak Surveillance(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10355026) which is available on the IEEE Xplore. For the Spring 2024 semester, I am working as a Teaching Assistant for the course CPSC 349-02 Frontend Engineering. Apart from this I also work at the Center of Computational and Applied Mathematics Department of CSUF on Supercomputers as a High Performance Computing (HPC) Student Assistant in the domain of linux, servers, python and more. I also participated in the Social Justice Competition held at CSU Fullerton working on an idea to reduce food wastage problem. In 2023, I attended 3 hackathons - Treehacks at Stanford, LAHacks at UCLA and CalHacks at UCB working on ideas and completing them during the duration of the hackathon.\\n\\nI am an international student and my parents are retired now. My father worked as a Manager in a private company and my mother is a homemaker.\\n\\nI have 2+ years of experience in software development and recently interned at Lumen Technologies as software developer. I wish to work as a software developer for the next couple of years and slowly transition towards an software architect role in the longer run as a career path.\\n\\nThis scholarship will help me a lot since as an international student I have taken an education loan. The Purpura internship scholarship will help me pay some part of my fees and reduce the loan amount to some extent. I am glad and proud to say that since I worked as an RA and now TA I am able to manage some of my living expenses with its salary.\\n\\n\\nAsk Krishna Prakash - AWS\\n\\nCold Email Yelp\\n\\nnbaarde@yelp.com\\n\\nDear Nicole,\\n\\nI hope this email finds you well.

Game of life\\tUse bit encoding type of solution to save state, like 0->1 then 2, 1->1 will be 3.\\n48. Rotate Image\\tDo swapping and reverse the matrix\\n54. Spiral Matrix\\tTake 4 variables and individual create the spiral matrix\\n56. Merge Intervals\\tInterval problm so make a timeline for better chances of solving problem.\\n\\tSort and iterate while checking prev end and curr start, if true then change interval else not\\n57. Insert Interval\\tTake min of starts and max of ends to insert\\n150. Eval RPN\\tTake stack and pop elements when expression is found and calculate to push stack val back to stack\\n224. Basic Calculator\\tTake sign, stack, res. Keep track of sign and res in a list. Pop them and multiple sign and add the other value\\n2. Add Two Numbers\\tTake carry, l1val l2val and know how to use total%10 and total//10\\n92. Reversed Linked List\\tHard to code, but came up with logic.\\n\\tTake a dummy node at start to handle edge cases also. Go till left then reverse till Right and adjust the pointers \\n\\tafter the right to get the final result.\\n61. Rotate List\\tBreak the link at the desired node and just attach the remaining to the start of the list\\n86. Partition list\\tTake two list left and right. Smaller than x goes to left and bigger goes to right. Once done just connect left and right to get the final list of the solution\\n226. Invert BT\\tJust swap two elements and then call recursively left and right nodes\\n105. Construct BT from preorder and inorder\\tPreorder tells you root and inorder tell you till which node you have to put the values in left tree. \\n106. Construct BT from inorder and postorder\\tSimilar logic as 105 above. Get the root and pop the elements from the postorder list. But recursively call root.right first since postorder is rRL\\n138. Copy LL with random pointer\\tDo two passes. One pass to make just the nodes with deep copy. Second pass to do the linking wrt to the original LL. Use dict to store old to new\\n129. Sum root leaf numbers\\tRecursively get the number and store as left and right and just return left+right from the inner dfs funciton. The number created as num*10 + root.val\\n114. Flatten binary tree\\tA bit tricky to code the solution. Inner function to reroute pointer and call recursively.\\n117. Populating next right pointers II\\tDo BFS and just connect to next node\\n236. Least Common ancestor for two nodes\\tDo recursive call and just check if l and r are present if yes then return root\\n199. Binary right side view\\tJust do BFS and add the last element to queue\\n173. Binary Search Tree iterator\\tUse stack and perform in order. Pop elements and traverse towards the left nodes for inorder.\\n98. Validate BST\\tPerform inorder and check if the sorted set list is equal to the non sorted list  if yes its BST else not\\n207. Course Schedule\\tDo DFS. This is graph problem where check for a cycle in the graph if found then return False.\\n108. Array to BST\\tTake midpoint and do recursion by making nodes. Since the array is sorted then the BST would be constructed directly\\n127. Word Ladder\\tDifficult to problem. Graph with BFS. Make graph using defaultdict(list). Trick to create the correct graph. Eg. H*t = [hot, hit, …] words are stored like this.\\nSaw neetcode solution\\n79. Word Search\\tDo 4 calls with OR and take a visited set array to store i,j and remove it after recursive calls.\\n23. Merge K Sorted Lists\\tPut all LL values in an array, sort it and then create nodes in another loop\\n53. Maximum Subarray\\tKadane algorithm. Keep adding numbers if negative then reset to 0. take max of currMax with globalMax and that is the answer\\n918. Max Sum Circular Subarray\\t\\n373. K smallest pairs\\tUse heap and store the next 2 pairs. Once you pop from the heap it will be minimum sum indexes and append it to ans.\\n502. IPO\\tMake capital profit vector and use max heap to store max profit. So every time u pop u get max proft and add to w to get final ans\\n198. House Robber \\tCreate a 1d DP array. Choose the current and two places behind money or just the prev one whichever is greater and return the last dp value\\n120. Triangle\\tUsing DP. Start from bottom and just add minimum of upper value and upper right value. Ans will be at 0,0\\n64. Minimum Path Sum\\tUse 2d DP and add previous minimum value with current grid value\\n63. Unique Paths II\\tUse 2d DP with obstacle changing to 0 when see it and others changing/adding to the current value\\n97. Interleaving String\\tUse 2d dp. Rows cols is s1 and s2 and compare each position with s3 value. Tricky question to visulize\\n188. Buy and Sell Stock IV\\t2d dp with transactions as rows and prices as columns and you calculate the max profit for all previous days till ystrday for 1 transaction and the second transction will be ystrday buy and today sell, whichever is maximum. Algorihtms made easy solution was easy to understand\\n399. Evaluate Division\\tUse dfs or bfs createa defauldict(dict) to store the nodes. Basically you need to make a graph which goes a-> b -> and has value and then the inverse value of the reverse path. Hard to code.\\n4. Median of two sorted arrays\\tUse Two pointers or binary search to solve.\\n805. Split array with same avg\\tCalculate total sum and avg, then look for a  subset of numbers whose avg is close to half of the total avg. If found return True since the second subset avg will be equal. Uses a possible sets dict/set to find all sets and then look for avg half to the total.\\n1895. Largest Magic Square\\t\\n287. Find duplicate number\\tTo adhere to the conditions and solving the problem --> Use Floyds cycle detection algorithm i.e slow-fast pointer approach\\n547. Number of Provinces\\tDo dfs. You just have to check if from any city i  how many j are connected with i,j as 1. Doable problem in interview if you understand the question.\\n205. Isomorphic Strings\\tCreate two dict and match the values. If same then true else false.\\n179. Largest Number\\tBasically a sorting problem, but need to write your own sorting logic. Convert to strings and join current number with next and check which is larger. If larger then swap else pass. Do this for all numbers. TC is O(n^2)\\n135. Candy\\t\\n221. Maximal Square\\tUsing DP.
